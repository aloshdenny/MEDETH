# MED_ETH
Med_ETH is a decentralized Ethereum-based medical record network that utilizes IPFS technology to securely store patient data widely over the planet's medical industry.


Med_ETH tackles a multitude of problem by incorporating the Web3 element. By using IPFS, no one entity/hospital has rights access to your medical data. You are the owner and you choose who to share it with. IPFS also provides an all-in-on medical card incentive layer: your wallet stores all your medical credentials and records and shrugs away the need to carry physical documents with you everywhere. And even if you don't have your docs with you, just signing into your wallet at any hospital allows the medical staff to gain access to your data.

Suppose you want to disclose sensitive data without actually disclosing it? This is where zk-SNARKs come in, a novel technology that we are experimenting on (future scope) where patients can prove to the doctor that they have so-and-so problems without revealing the diagnosis of the problems itself.

In the near future, if we are successful we plan to shift Med_ETH to its own blockchain platform (eg: MedChain) using HyperLedger Fabric, which offers proprietary blockchain services.
